# Welcome to the Radish Framework!

The Radish Framework is a in-development toolkit for building primarily 2D games for desktop platforms. If you've ever used frameworks like [Love2D](https://love2d.org/), Radish will feel quite familiar.

Games for the Radish Framework are written in JavaScript (or any language that can compile to JavaScript), with Typescript supported as a first-class citizen. It also leverages NodeJS to provide a project management system that can download binaries and create releases for you. Using JavaScript and NodeJS gives the developer access to a huge amount of usable libraries and a scripting language that feels more comfortable than most other languages (for instance, Lua).

The Radish Framework is primarily developed by [Audrey Castillo](https://github.com/Valax321), a games programmer who worked on a commercial game exactly once and now does esoteric games programming on the side while living on a deserted island (allegedly).

## Project Structure

This organization has two primary repositories:
- [The Framework Runtime](https://github.com/RadishFramework/Runtime), a native C++ project that runs games within a JavaScript virtual machine.
- [The SDK](https://github.com/RadishFramework/SDK), which is built on NodeJS and provides user-facing project management tools.

## License

Both the Runtime and SDK for the Radish Framework are licensed under the MIT license, making them suitable for use in commercial game projects.
